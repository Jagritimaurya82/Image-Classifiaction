# Image-Classifiaction
 Image classification is where a computer can analyse an image and identify the ‘class’ the image falls under. (Or a probability of the image being part of a ‘class’.) A class is essentially a label, for instance, ‘car’, ‘animal’, ‘building’ and so on.
For example, you input an image of a sheep. Image classification is the process of the computer analysing the image and telling you it’s a sheep
